# In-browser medical volume renderer

Attempt at making a volume renderer with WebGL. 
See Wiki for installation / usage instructions (has animated gif images).

DISCLAIMER: The project still needs some overhauls + it is not being actively developed at the moment. The picking buffer previews beneath, console logs and other junk is just there for development but should not affect performance that hard.
